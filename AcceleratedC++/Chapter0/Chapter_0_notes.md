## Program Structure

C++ programs are **free form**

- spaces are required only when they keep adjacent symbols from running together
  - newlines are just another kind of space

## String Literals

Characters enclosed in quotes

## include directives

```c++
#include <name>
```

must appear on a line by themselves (Except for comments)

## Comments

use // for comment /\*\*/ for multiline comments

## Types

define data structures and operations on those data stuctures.

- Two kinds of types
  - built into the core language
  - defind outside such as std::ostream

## Namespaces

Mechanism for grouping related names

- Standard Library names are in std::

## Definitions an Headers

The standard library defines its names in headers, which programs access through #include
